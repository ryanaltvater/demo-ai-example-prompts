I want a section with two distinct rows of content followed by a card section:

For the first row, create a 2-column layout with an image in one column and content in the other. The content column should have a H2 heading, followed by a couple of paragraphs of text.

For the second row, create the same layout but with the columns in the reverse order.

For the third section, create a row with four equal cards. Each card should have a header with an image, a body with paragraph text, and a footer with a button link. Remove the border around each card, and add a gray-10 background.
