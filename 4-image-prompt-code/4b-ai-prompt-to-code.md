Row 1:

-   Remove all padding from both card bodies
-   Remove bottom margin from the row

Row 2:

-   Two cards with borders
-   First card (8 columns): Contains a content area (H3, paragraph, secondary CTA) spanning 8 columns on the left, and a 4-column image on the right
-   Second card (4 columns): Contains an H3 heading in the body and a button link in the footer

Row 3:

-   Three equal-width cards with borders
-   Each card contains an H3 heading in the body
-   Each card has a footer with a button (no text) positioned in the bottom-right corner
