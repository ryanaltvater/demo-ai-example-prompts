I want a section with three distinct rows of card content:

For the first row, create two cards without headers, footers, or borders. The first card should span 8 columns with just a H2 heading inside. The second card should span 4 columns and have a button link aligned to the right. Remove all padding from both card bodies and remove the bottom margin from the row itself.

For the second row, create two more cards. The first card should span 8 columns and contain a content area on the left (with a H3 heading, some paragraph text, and secondary CTA), and a 4-column image on the right side. The second card should span 4 columns and have just a H3 in the body and a button link in the footer.

For the third row, create three equal cards taking up one-third of the width. Each card should have a H3 heading in the body, followed by a footer that contains a button with no text, positioned in the bottom-right corner of the card.
