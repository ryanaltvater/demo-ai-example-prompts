I want a section with a single row of card content:

Create two cards, arranged in a 2-column layout. Each card should contain a body with a H2 heading, followed by some paragraph text. The footer of each card should include a secondary CTA and a button link, positioned side-by-side. Each card should span 6 columns, to create an evenly divided layout.
