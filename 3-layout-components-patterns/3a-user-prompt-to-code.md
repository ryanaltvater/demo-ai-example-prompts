I want a section with three distinct rows of content:

For the first row, create a layout with a centered heading that spans the full width of the container.

For the second row, implement a tabbed interface with three centered tabs. The first tab's panel should contain an events list with 7 events. The other two tabs' panels can have placeholder "lorem ipsum" content.

For the third row, create a layout with centered paragraph text on a gray-10 background.
